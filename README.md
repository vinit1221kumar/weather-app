# weather-app

This is a simple and responsive weather information showing web app built with HTML, Sass, and Modern JavaScript. This will display current weather information in your location, and you can also enter any city in the world to view current weather details for that city.

When you visit this web app, it will first try to get your location by using your browser's location details, and if that fails, it will get your location by using your IP address and show weather details based on that location.
